      h2 From idea to MVP

        p In the beginning, we have to learn all about your project. During the initial meetings we look at all the materials you have prepared so far (feature lists, mockups, designs) and plan how to approach the development. We prepare a rough estimate of what needs to be built and the amount of time it will take. After you accept it, we start the development process.

        p We hold weekly (or more frequent) meetings with you to make sure we're on the same page. You can see the real time progress as we constantly update you and share what we have built. Clicking through the application allows you to easily suggest changes and make better decisions. You can also share our work with the potential customers to get their feedback. We can then incorporate suggestions into the application.

        p At the end of this stage, we have a complete application with the core functionality that will attract the first customers and investors.

      h2 Growth
      p class="lead" We start with the MVP we built together (or your existing application), discuss more complex features and build a complete product. We take care of performance, scaling and deployment.

        p As the product grows in complexity and requirements, so should the development team. We regularly monitor the situation and make sure that the team has the exact skillset required for the upcoming challenges.

        p Whether it's building APIs for mobile apps, designing and maintaining infrastructure for hosting, or creating ambitious SPA interfaces - we've done that, and we can do it for you.

        p We still share the progress with you regularly so that you can provide your ideas, suggestions and feedback based on what you see. Tracking and logging tools that we use allow you to monitor the behaviors of the visiting users. This helps in further tailoring of the application to their needs.

      h2 Long-term support
      p class="lead" We provide a long term support for the application that you built with us, help recruit and train local team or provide consultations in regards to the performance or security. We help stabilize your product for a long term success.

      div class="collapse" id="collapse-support"
        p At some point, there comes a time when either the application is complete and only occasional bugfixes are needed, or you want to transition the development to your internal team.

        p In either case, we can help you. We offer support contracts for the applications we've built. If there's any bug that needs fixing, or another feature to be added, we're here to help you.

        p We have a proven process for handing off the development to internal teams. We help you recruit, hire and train developers. As your team grows, we gradually reduce our involvement.
